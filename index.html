  <p>"Sighted learners learn new information in what’s called “whole to part.” They see the whole picture, they see all of the parts of the picture all at one time, simultaneously, and are able to tell where that fits in relation to other objects around it; for instance, size, distance, that kind of thing. Tactile learners learn in exactly the opposite direction. They learn part to whole. They get the information from what they’re looking at — for instance, a tactile graphic — with whatever they’re seeing at that moment. What you touch is what you see. And they have to put all of the little pieces of information together in a sequence to come up with a whole picture. They have to build a whole picture out of all these little, tiny views. So teaching students to compile that information is an important piece of instruction."</p>
